"[working system that can be evaluated](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/build-incrementally-with-fast-integrated-learning-cycles/)"

Work Items do NOT have to be limited to the end users direct benefit. [Enabler stories](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/enablers/) typically are the majority of Iteration 0.

As a user I want to know my account balances.
As a Developer in the team I want to be able to track changes to the code over time.

If our goal is to iteratively produce something that is demonstrable, with quality and is testable.

Definition of Ready ( Work Item)

* Description of the value/functionality this tasks brings and to whom.
* What is the expected artifact when done?
* How will this artifact be validated?
* Are dependent tasks identified?
* Size, Epic Feature PBI/UserStory.

Definition of Ready (Bug)

* Steps to reproduce. (Videos are great)
* Does a test to reproduce the bug make sense? (Judgement call on value of a test case)
* To which User story does the bug relate?  This helps find the context. (Optional)
