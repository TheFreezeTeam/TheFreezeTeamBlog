#Backlog ready

<input type="checkbox"> Item 1

The Backlog must be in a ready state prior to doing Sprint planning.  I can not emphasize this enough.

#Definition of ready

>A checklist of conditions that must be true before a product backlog item is considered ready to pull into a sprint during sprint planning.
