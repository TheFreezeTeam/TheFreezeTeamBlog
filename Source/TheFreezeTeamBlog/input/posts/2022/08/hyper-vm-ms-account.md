# Why can't I log in to a Windows Hyper-V VM with my Microsoft Account

So I want to test Azure VPN service.  I use Hyper-V Quick Create to create VM
![Quick Create VM](./vm.png)

By default an admin user named "User" is created with no password.

If you click on Start and then the User Avatar

It will bring you to the Account Settings.

If I set up my Microsoft account I can no longer log into the VM.  When connecting I get "The password is incorrect. Try again.

So why can't I login??
