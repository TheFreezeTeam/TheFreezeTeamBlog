I've been a little down on agile lately, and namely, scrum. I've been grappling with the concept of the vertically-sliced, end-user focused user story as the means to forward progress on a project.

Mainly what I've been thinking lately is how stupid it is. Which led me to think, how could those Agile Manifesto guys have been so idiotic. They foisted this ridiculous idea on us and we've been suffering from it ever since.

I mean, the statement "we value vertically-sliced user stories over rational thought and coherent design" ... it's right there in the Agile Manifesto, isn't it? I'm sure it is. It's right there on line ...

Let's see. I'll find it here in a minute. Let me pull out my pocket version.  Flipping through it now.

Oh yeah, blah, blah, favor individuals and interactions. Yeah. Hmmm ... right. Customer collaboration, sure. Responding to change. Yack, yack, yack.

Aha!!! There it is, right there on LINE TWO ...

**"WORKING SOFTWARE OVER COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION"**

And there you have it, a verbatim quote of what I said a minute ago.

(Psssstttt ... that's not a verbatim quote. Shut up.)

So let's think about this for a minute. Weren't they mostly reacting to large-company software development process in the nineties that favored large requirements documents and formal specifications? And to this mindset they said, "Hey, why don't we just try to get some stuff working."

But I ask you, did they ever say that every single fucking piece of work has to be encapsulated into an end-user focused story and delivered in three weeks or less? NO THEY DID NOT. Maybe we can still use our brains after all.

Let me close with a brief review of Genesis 1. Follow along with your copy of the Bible. I'm sure it says the same thing as mine. So right there in the middle part. On the fifth day he invented the C compiler. UNIX on the sixth day. Rested on the seventh (well, not quite. He spent all day typing "ps -ef | grep java" into his Bash shell and thinking, "that's cool"). On the eighth day he invented the vertically-sliced user story, and that comes right before the story of Noah's Ark where he destroys the entire planet and starts over. Coincidence? I think not.
