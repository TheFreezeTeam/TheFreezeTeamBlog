So I've had this idea for a while that the way to improvement software development productivity isn't to focus directly on productivity, but to instead look for points of friction, remove the points of friction, and productivity will be a natural byproduct.

It seems like a perfectly reasonable notion to me. But you know what ... it hasn't worked. I don't mean the idea hasn't worked, I mean the way I've been going about selling the idea to management hasn't worked.

So what's the problem? Am I just an old-school curmudgeon, hopelessly out-of-touch with modern day software development realities? There are days when I become cynical and depressed, thinking maybe that is true.

But today I had an ephiphany. The problem isn't with the idea. It is, after all, completely rational. The problem has been the way I've been trying to sell the idea to management.

For some reason, the vernacular "removing points of friction" doesn't resonate with management. I guess they don't know what that means. Also, I think the idea comes across as being too self-centered. I think what management is hearing from me is that I want to remove *my* points of friction (which is true, to a degree). And they think that what I'm proposing is to introduce loads of new beauracracy in order to make *my* job easier. They say I want to drag everyone else down in order to make life easier for me.

These same managers, however, seem to resonate perfectly well with the term "removing waste". It's the same dang thing. I say friction, they say waste. Removing waste sells, removing friction doesn't. Why?

First, because they know the term "removing waste". It's all over the agile software development literature, so they're familiar with it, and they can accept it. Second, nobody wants waste. Every manager knows waste is bad and costs the company money. Tell them you want to remove waste, and they're all ears. But friction? Who gives a sh*t. Who cares if your job is hard? Big deal. That's what they pay you the big bucks for.

This feeds into my second epiphany. One of the things I've been harping on for a while is documentation. I don't me big, huge, up-front requirements kind of documentation. I mean the more write-as-you-go documentation like JavaDocs, JSDocs, Markdown files, etc. So "less friction through documentation" is a pretty tough sell. But management is very receptive to automated testing, to the point that it is now a required component of our user story acceptance criteria.

"Less friction through documentation". Fail.<br />
"Reduce waste with automated testing". Sold.

Dos and don'ts of selling ideas to management:

***DO*** exhibit courage<br />
***DO*** think about how the idea will ultimately impact the customer.<br />
***DO*** think about how the idea will make more sausage, not simply improve the sausage making process without a clear end-benefit.<br />
***DO*** think about how the idea can be dovetailed into the existing framework of the organization.<br />

***DON'T*** propose ideas that will be perceived as adding unnecessary beauracracy.<br />
***DON'T*** propose that someone else should do more work so that you can do less work.
***DON'T*** create unnecessary extra software components that will simply be one more thing to maintain.
