Hey there! Welcome to the new Ghost editor - affectionately known as Koenig.
Koenig is a brand new writing experience within Ghost, and follows more of a rich writing experience which you've come to expect from the best publishing platforms. Don't worry though! You can still use Markdown too, if that's what you prefer.
Because there are some changes to how Ghost outputs content using its new editor, we dropped this draft post into your latest update to tell you a bit about it – and simultaneously give you a chance to preview how well your theme handles these changes. So after reading this post you should both understand how everything works, and also be able to see if there are any changes you need to make to your theme in order to upgrade to Ghost 2.0.
