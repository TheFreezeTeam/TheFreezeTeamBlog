  * Add Data Disk to VM via Azure. 
  * [Expand azure hard drive to 1GB](http://www.thefreezeteam.com/2017/01/15/azure-resize-os-drive/)

* Open Cmder in Powershell and `Install-Module posh-git`
* Pin Cmder to task bar or Start Menu.
 

## Dev-Environment
* Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 6.9.4 (for this blog)
 >Don't install 7 or higher until you are sure [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) support is compatible. 

Confirm Node is installed and in the path. Open Cmder and run `node -v`.  you should see the following:

```
λ  node -v
  v6.9.4
```
While at it what determine the version of npm and yarn? `npm -v`

```
λ  npm -v
3.10.10

λ  yarn --version
0.19.1
```

**What is node?**

> Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

**What is npm?**

>npm is the package manager for JavaScript. Find, share, and reuse packages of code from hundreds of thousands of developers — and assemble them in powerful new ways.

**What is yarn?**
>Yarn is a package manager for your code. It allows you to use and share code with other developers from around the world. Yarn does this quickly, securely, and reliably so you don’t ever have to worry. We are going to use yarn in place of npm.
